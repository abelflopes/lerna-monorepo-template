# Versioned Monorepo Template

This project showcases a monorepo template with independent versioning capabilities. Versioning is based on semantic commits and is applied to to the packages and to the whole project itself.

## Features

<!-- TODO: document features of this template -->

## What is used?

- [Lerna](https://github.com/lerna/lerna)
- [Semantic Release](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint)
- [Commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint)
- [Github Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

## Commands

| Command name | Description |
| -- | -- |
| `npm run prepare` | Runs the project development preparation scripts (runs automatically after npm install). |
| `npm start` | compiles into dist in watch mode |
| `npm run build` | Runs the build command for all packages |
| `npm run test` | Runs the test command for all packages |
| `npm run lint` | Run static code analysis |
| `npm run clean` | Clean production output for all packages |
| `npm run todo` | List all TODO's and FIXME's |

## Package Standards & Guidelines

All packages should match the following standards and guidelines
 in order to allow a linear maintenance capability and overall project readability.

### Commands

| Command name | Description |
| -- | -- |
| `npm start` | Run development mode build in watch mode |
| `npm run build` | Build the production output |
| `npm run test` | Run tests once |
| `npm run clean` | Clean production output |

### Structure

| Path | Description |
| -- | -- |
| `dist` | Location of production output files |
| `src` | Location of source code files, ideally having an `index` file as entry point |
| `README.md` | Entry point for the package documentation, the documentation should cover all the distribution output and should link to package development documentation |

## Package Visibility & Package Registries

Ensure all of the packages are either [public or private](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/package-json#private) as specifically intended.

Set up a `.npmrc` file or npm authentication in order to publish to the desired registry (npm/github, etc).
